      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This recipe has been a long time in coming, years actually. I've been
        trying out recipes for ham and cheese tortillas for what seems like
        forever - but I've never been thrilled with any of them. Definitely not
        thrilled enough to blog them - too dry, too sticky, too crisp, too
        bland, too soggy, too complicated. This time, with these tortillas, it's
        different. They totally live up to their name - Best Ever Homemade ham
        and cheese Tortillas!

        Tortillas are round, thin, flat bread from Mexico made from unleavened
        cornmeal or, less commonly, wheat flour. Traditionally, the corn for
        tortillas was boiled with unslaked lime to soften the kernels and loosen
        the hulls. The grains were ground on a stone saddle quern, or metate.
        Small pieces of dough were patted by hand into thin disks, a task
        requiring considerable dexterity. The tortilla was then baked on a
        comal, a griddle of earthenware or iron. Today most tortillas are
        purchased at tortiller√≠as, where the dough is mixed by machine, stamped
        into disks, and passed by conveyer belt over a flame.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Beat together eggs and milk. Heat a lightly oiled skillet (or
          non-stick pan) over medium high heat and cook egg mixture, stirring
          occasionally, until firm. When almost done, stir in ham, green onions,
          salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon 1/4 of the egg mixture on top of each tortilla. Sprinkle the
          eggs with cheese, fold over the tortilla to make a roll and top with
          salsa if desired.
