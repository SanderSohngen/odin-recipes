    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      In culinary school we learned that a chef is only as good as the omelet
      they make. Well, that's intimidating. I've since learned that it really
      doesn't have to be. Omelets are no scarier than good scrambled eggs. A
      gentle drag then fold creates the perfect blanket for cheese and your
      favorite fillings. Here are a few tips so you can be a master chef of
      breakfast.

    <p>
      An Omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a
      frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for
      the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables,
      mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, or some combination of the
      above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of
      milk, cream, or water.

        Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
        mushrooms and onion until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add spinach; cook
        until spinach wilts, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in egg mixture; swirl pan
        around to evenly distribute egg mixture. Cook until egg is fully cooked
        and set in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into wedges.
