      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This is a recipe you'll want to use year round, but since it uses eggnog
        it makes it an extra special holiday treat that my family requests
        weekly! To make it even more flavorful, soak and refrigerate the bread
        overnight in a large baking dish. Serve warm with powdered sugar and
        syrup if you like. The French toast goes well with scrambled eggs, too.
        Enjoy!

        Toast is commonly eaten with butter or margarine, soup or sweet
        toppings, such as jam or jelly. Regionally, savory spreads, such as
        peanut butter or a yeast extract, may also be popular. Buttered toast
        may also accompany savory dishes, especially soups or stews, and be
        topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or baked beans as a light
        meal. Toast is a common breakfast food. Bagels and English muffins are
        also toasted.
